							<h3>The future</h3>
							<p>What is so special about the future that many people dream about? I wanted to start my blog with this question.
								Why Is the future so relevant for some people? Is because we are not comfortable the way we are and we need to seek something else?
								Are we trying to clinch our thirst in a endless bucket of desires or are we looking beyond our limits?
								Technology has been the closes thing that people has seen to a miraculous growth to the future. And is not the future the pursue of something better that  although is not here is worth
								pursuing it?
							</p>
							<p>Starting my career in technology in Madrid, Spain, and then moving to Sillicon Valley I consider the future as the purpose of waking up every morning.
								The meaning of trying to write your own story. That story lead me to Drones back when I was 20 years old. And 9 years later, I've been involved in a small drone start up which 
								pursues to lead critical infraestructure inspection in Spain and Europe. I also worked for a "Flying Car" company which game me friends, entire days of hussling and poor b&b it also gave me one of the best experiences of running a business in the bay.
								And now, at Skydio. One of the leading drone companies in the United States and in the world.
							</p>
							<p>After walking my path I became to realize that you have to cultivate the future by purely attending the present. 
								Aside from that experience in the drone industry, I started a small business idea, got married and now I'm waiting my first baby.
								I also went back to school to continue my education in the US.
								So the future for me is the desire to grow and change in order to be my best version. And push as hard as I can to make life worth living.

								<p>To improve is to change, to be perfect is to change often<br/> -W.Churchill <!--<a href="http://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a>. --> </p>
